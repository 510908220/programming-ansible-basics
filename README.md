Two examples about how to use Ansible coding by Python.

- test_modules.py : set up the environment to run an Ansible module
- test_playbook.py: creat an inventory and loads a .yml file with a playbook, then runs the playbook and shows the results like Ansible CLI tools does

Other files:
- ansible.cfg : just a basic Ansible configuration file
- test.yml : simple playbook
